# Learning Quantitative Finance with R
This is the code repository for [Learning Quantitative Finance with R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-pyspark?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781786463708), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
Apache Spark is an open source framework for efficient cluster computing with a strong interface for data parallelism and fault tolerance. This book will show you how to leverage the power of Python and put it to use in the Spark ecosystem. You will start by getting a firm understanding of the Spark 2.0 architecture and how to set up a Python environment for Spark.

You will get familiar with the modules available in PySpark. You will learn how to abstract data with RDDs and DataFrames and understand the streaming capabilities of PySpark. Also, you will get a thorough overview of machine learning capabilities of PySpark using ML and MLlib, graph processing using GraphFrames, and polyglot persistence using Blaze. Finally, you will learn how to deploy your applications to the cloud using the spark-submit command.

By the end of this book, you will have established a firm understanding of the Spark Python API and how it can be used to build data-intensive applications.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 02.

The code will look like the following:
          
        
        > y <- dnorm(Sampledata$Return, mean = mean(Sampledata$Return), 
        sd =sd(Sampledata$Return, na.rm = FALSE))
        > plot(Sampledata$Return,y) 


### Software requirements:
Download and install R for various platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. Go to the following link: https://cran.rstudio.com/.
R is an open source platform and can be installed free of charge for any operating system from:
